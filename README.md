# CLIPDT

Welcome to CLIPDT.com! 

First you will need to savethe files locally
    - Hit Code
    - Then open with GitHub Desktop
    - From there, you will be able to save to your desired file path

From there, open your Terminal or a tool you use to run your code locally
    - Access your file and make sure you have Python installed

Once you run the CLIPDT_main file, you will see a welcome message

Then, you will be asked to enter a Month using a numerical value (1 through 12).

Next, enter a year dating back as far as 1851 using all 4 numerical values (i.e. 1999 instead of 99).
    - To see sections other than ‘Archives,’ please enter a date after June 1980.
    - NOTE: The Arts section was created in June 1980, so we recommend using a date starting after 1981 to get the most information available. 

Lastly, enter the section of the New York Times you’d like to access from the list of valid items.
    - Note: The API response tends to lag so you will see a message letting you know that the API is working and loading based on your inputs

Hit enter and then wait for a list of relevant articles. 

The result is that you will see articles based on the month, year, and section you entered!

Enjoy!
